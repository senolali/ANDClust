<h1>Python Implementation of ANDClust Clustering Algorithm</h1>
<br><br>
Although density-based clustering algorithms can successfully define clustersin arbitrary shapes, they encounter issues if the dataset has varying densitiesor neck-typed clusters due to the requirement for precise distance parameters,such as eps parameter of DBSCAN. These approches assume that datadensity is homogenous, but this is rarely the case in practice. In this study, anew clustering algorithm named ANDClust (Adaptive NeighborhoodDistance-based Clustering Algorithm) is proposed to handle datasets withvarying density and/or neck-typed clusters. The algorithm consists of threeparts. The first part uses Multivariate Kernel Density Estimation (MulKDE) tofind the datasetâ€™s peak points, which are the start points for the MinimumSpanning Tree (MST) to construct clusters in the second part. Lastly, anAdaptive Neighborhood Distance (AND) ratio is used to weigh the distancebetween the data pairs. This method enables this approach to supportinter-cluster and intra-cluster density varieties by acting as if the distanceparameter differs for each data of the dataset. ANDClust is tested on syntheticand real datasets to reveal its efficiency. The algorithm shows superiorclustering quality in a good run-time compared to its competitors. Moreover,ANDClust could effectively define clusters of arbitrary shapes and processhigh-dimensional, imbalanced datasets may have outliers.<br>
